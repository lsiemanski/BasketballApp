    <p>
        All these drills could be done in stationary position or with movement.
        <ol>
            <li>Hard Pound – Driving the ball with power into the ground using the fingertips.</li>
            <li>Baby Dribbles – Keep the basketball below the ankles. If you’re stationary doing this drill, work the ball around your legs.</li>
            <li>Pound Crossover – This is a hard dribble where you change hands with power.</li>
            <li>Between the Legs – Be sure your legs are in a straight line when the ball is crossed over between the legs. Those who are stationary will do a scissor action.</li>
            <li>Behind the Back – Be sure you change hands quickly.</li>
        </ol>
