    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Ray Allen shooting drills is a great drill that you can use for a shooting warm up or end the workout in a fun, competitive manner. It can easily be adapted for beginners and pros.
        <br/>
        There are 5 lines. From each line, there are 5 spots. This is approximately the distance on each shot:
    </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Spot 1 - 4 Feet</li>
        <li>Spot 2 - 8 Feet</li>
        <li>Spot 3 - 12 Feet</li>
        <li>Spot 4 - 16 Feet</li>
        <li>Spot 5 - 20 Feet</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
    You have to make a shot from spot 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 in 5 consecutive shots in order to advance to the next line. If you miss from any of the spots, you start over in that line.
    <br/>
    If you miss a shot in line 3, you start over from line 3. You don't go back to line 1.
    Your goal is to finish all 5 lines in 2 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2>Regressions and progressions</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move back a spot after each make - Rather than making 5 shots in a row,
                you allow the players to move back a spot after each make even if they miss in between.</li>
            <li>Use 3 or 4 Spots - Instead of using 5 spots, you can make it a little bit easier by only making them go to spot 3 or 4.</li>
            <li>6 Spots - For more advanced players, you can add an extra spot.</li>
            <li>Kyle Korver Status - Make 25 shots in a row.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
